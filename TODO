TODO?
-----
- edge budget:owner ratio
  - assume all nodes have the same interests
- power law distribution for nodes per owner w/ mode=2?
  => can vaguely approximate with uniform distribution and O comparagble to V
- message delivery (suspect knn greediness will make more sense here)
- test cases for known/standard graph forms

BUGS (Please ping me if you encounter others!)
----
plot: (aka: Axes of Evil)
- sometimes the 3rd column y-axis seems to be occluded for some reason; only on the first  couple of rows.

util.rb:
- binomial distribution centering doesn't really generate a helpful spread of properties.

graph.rb:
- unpopular nodes reach their proactive peer budget but may not reach their total peer budget when no one else chooses them.  This is a bit wasteful.
